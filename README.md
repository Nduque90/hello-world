Creating a new repository to test out the Hello-world program

My name is Nancy Carman and I’m in my last semester for my Masters in Geosciences at UW-Milwaukee! My current research focuses on understanding the relationship between kinematic partitioning and the strain magnitude of a shear zone deformed in the mid-lower crust in Andalucia, Spain. This will allows us to further understand the fluid’s role in strain localization, which is an essential process in plate tectonics. I’ll be conducting a qualitative strain analysis in the field coupled with a microstructural and XRF analysis as well.]

	I’ve used Python extensively and R a few times throughout my undergraduate and graduate courses. Though haven’t done programming in a little while so a little refresher would be nice!
